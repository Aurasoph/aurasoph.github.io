<div class="specification">
<p>A company performs an experiment on the efficiency of a liquid that is used to detect a nut allergy.</p>
<p>A group of 60 people took part in the experiment. In this group 26 are allergic to nuts. One person from the group is chosen at random.</p>
</div>
<div class="specification">
<p>A second person is chosen from the group.</p>
</div>
<div class="specification">
<p>When the liquid is added to a personâ€™s blood sample, it is expected to turn blue if the person is allergic to nuts and to turn red if the person is not allergic to nuts.</p>
<p>The company claims that the probability that the test result is correct is 98% for people who are allergic to nuts and 95% for people who are not allergic to nuts.</p>
<p>It is known that 6 in every 1000 adults are allergic to nuts.</p>
<p>This information can be represented in a tree diagram.</p>
