<p>Runners in an athletics club have season’s best times for the 100 m, which can be modelled by a normal distribution with mean 11.6 seconds and standard deviation 0.8 seconds. To qualify for a particular competition a runner must have a season’s best time of under 11 seconds. A runner from this club who has qualified for the competition is selected at random. Find the probability that he has a season’s best time of under 10.7 seconds.</p>
