<p>The number of taxis arriving at Cardiff Central railway station can be modelled by a Poisson distribution. During busy periods of the day, taxis arrive at a mean rate of 5.3 taxis every 10 minutes. Let T represent a random 10 minute busy period.</p>

b. <p>During quiet periods of the day, taxis arrive at a mean rate of 1.3 taxis every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Find the probability that during a period of 15 minutes, of which the first 10 minutes is busy and the next 5 minutes is quiet, that exactly 2 taxis arrive.</p>
